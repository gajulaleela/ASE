Dear Human Resources,

This email is in regards to my interest in applying for the Software Engineer position recently posted Monster Website. With my skill-set and competencies, I think I would be a good fit for the job's responsibilities

I started my career as a Software Developer with Tata Consultancy Services in July 2012 after receiving my Bachelor’s Degree. In my two years of working there, I was able to apply my technical knowledge in the practical world, gain experience in each stage of Software Development Life Cycle and gained expertise in latest technologies like Android, Java, J2EE etc. With the guidance from senior members, I gained proficiency in designing systems in an Object Oriented Approach. I efficiently coordinated with my 16 member team and also the onshore client which helped me understand how to be a good team player. While pursuing Master of Science in Computer Science from University of Missouri – Kansas City , I developed technical skills in MVC frameworks, web development, cloud computing, database administration.

I welcome the opportunity to meet with you in person to further discuss my qualifications. I have attached my resume highlighting my academic and professional skills and look forward to hearing from you

Yours Sincerely,



Leela Naga Devi Gajula
